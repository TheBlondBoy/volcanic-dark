__This is the repository for Volcanic Dark: A Minecraft resource pack that tries to both look good and *actually* be dark.__

If you've come here to ask me to add support a specific mod, feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/TheBlondBoy/volcanic-dark/issues)! Just a fair warning, I won't support *every* mod out there; Just the ones that are notable and have some popularity.
